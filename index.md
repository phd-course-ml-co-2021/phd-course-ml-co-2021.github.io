# Phd Course on Machine Learning and Constrained Optimization

All lectures will be made available through a dedicated [github organization](https://github.com/phd-course-ml-co-2021). Direct links are also available here:

* [Week 1: Constrained Optimization for Data Mining](https://github.com/phd-course-ml-co-2021/phd-ml-co-2021-01)
  - The main goal of this lectures will be to cover multiple techniques for constrained optimization, using a non-trivial data mining problem as a driving example
