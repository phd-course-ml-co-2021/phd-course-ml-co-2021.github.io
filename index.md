# Phd Course on Machine Learning and Constrained Optimization

The course calendar is accessible:

* [Via any browser (or Google Calendar)](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=4udmdpkb34r9vr7itvo713nneo%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FRome)
* [As a downloadable/subscribable ics file](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/4udmdpkb34r9vr7itvo713nneo%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

All lectures will be made available through a dedicated [github organization](https://github.com/phd-course-ml-co-2021). Direct links are also available here:

* [Part 1: Constrained Optimization for Data Mining](https://github.com/phd-course-ml-co-2021/phd-ml-co-2021-01)
  - The main goal of this lectures will be to cover multiple techniques for constrained optimization, using a non-trivial data mining problem as a driving example
* [Part 2: Machine Learning for Constrained Optimization](https://github.com/phd-course-ml-co-2021/phd-ml-co-2021-02/)
  - These lectures will cover the use of ML models to provide parameters or functional estimators for constrained optimization

Lecture recordings will also be made available from this web site:

* [Lecture 2](https://www.lompa.it/teaching/ML-CO-2021/20211206.mp4)
* [Lecture 3](https://www.lompa.it/teaching/ML-CO-2021/20211207.mp4)
